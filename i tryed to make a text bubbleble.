hey! im new ot github and accidentaly submitted this as an issue rather than a commit

if keyboard_check(vk_alt)
{

    textboxup = true;
    oTextbox.visible = 1;
}
This was the main code that I added.

basicly, there was an object that i positoned above the npc, and then i made a collision event that checks for my debug key (in this case ALT) and displays the sprite.
This did not take me an hour, but I had to fix a butt ton of bugs and movement errors
