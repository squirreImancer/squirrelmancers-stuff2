i fixed a bug that caused the character to not diplay the jumping sprite correctly, and began work on my second level involving doors and buttons
the bug in question was fixed by literally one line of code that i misstyped, but it took me an embarrassingly long time to find the error. it dident show up in debugging because it was displaying a differnt sprite instead. 
i should probably stop reusing code from other objects for this reason

instead of assigning JumpSPR to the sprite SPRjump it was being assigned to SPRnpctext, because i just reused the code from the npc
